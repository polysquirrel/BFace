        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="section">
  
          <h3>Baldur's Face</h3>
          Baldur's Face is a <i>WeiDU</i> mod for Infinity Engine games
          installing an included portrait pack and designed to be easily
          customizable by players to include their own collections.
        </div>
        

        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <div class="section">

          <h3>Supported games</h3>
          Currently supported games are: BGEE (with or without SoD), BG2EE 
          and EET(?). Additional games might be added in the future given
          demand.

          <h3>Compatibility</h3>
          This is a <i>WeiDU</i> mod which replaces original bitmap images	
          and modifies several creatures by giving them brand new portraits.
          As such, it should cause no conflicts with other weidu mods. Two
          potential exceptions are obviously other portrait mods and heavy
          UI reworks. In the first case, the last mod to be installed will
          overwrite the changes done by those installed previously. This 
          will not have any adverse effect on the game though; furthermore,
          the choice of installation options offered here is quite flexible  
          and should help with avoiding those conflicts. One minor conflict
          possibility is from an automatically installed script changing
          the portrait of one of BG2 characters to one of opposite sex in 
          the appropriate circumstances. If other mods offer similar function,
          it is best to avoid them or pick manual component selection for NPCs
          and skip the appropriate component here. As for GUI mods,
          the only cases which will cause trouble are potrait pickers which
          maintain separate portrait lists and do not use the standard API
          to retrieve portraits. In that case it is recommended to select
          the standard or 'independent' method when installing portraits for
          CHARNAME rather than direct patching of game files.
          See the description for <a href="#PC">PC portrait installation</a>.

          <h3>Installation order</h3>
          This mod should be installed after all mods adding characters for
          whom portraits are included here. In the minimum, after all NPC mods,
          but best after tweaks and together with UI mods. Of note, 
          <i>PortraitPicker</i> is installed best before this mod, as it will
          otherwise ignore portraits added by this mod unless the standard 
          installation method for custom portraits is chosen. If installed
          later, this mod will generate or update the list of portraits used by 
          <i>PortraitPicker</i> and add some basic category descriptions.	  
          <h3>A word of warning</h3>
          This mod is quite heavy on the installation options. While a lot
          of effort went - and goes - into testing various combinations
          and disabling those that make little sense, it may still be possible
          for the mod to enter to a conflict of sorts with itself. If you
          press it and look closely, you may even find a bug! Fortunately,
          typical installations can be made by choosing - and seeing - only
          two components.

        <h2 id="NPCs">Components with portraits for NPCs</h2>
        <div class="section">
	
          <h3>Portraits for NPCs</h3>
          The first (optional) component offers several preselected
          installation options, allowing to skip all following NPC components.
          Skipping it will skip also all other NPC components. You can either 
          choose take the full control over what will be installed, or select 
          one of combinations of NPC groups which should receive portraits from
          this mod. The individual group in questions are:
          <dl>
            <dt>Official companions</dt>
            <dd>
              All Bioware and Beamdog companions present in the unmodded game.
            </dd>
            <dt>Main plot characters</dt>
            <dd>
              Characters crucial to the plot - mainly adversaries - who already
              have portraits in the unmodded game.
            </dd>
            <dt>Mod companions</dt>
            <dd>
              Companions introduced by fan modifications. This will install 
              files only for currently installed NPCs. Sadly, not all existing 
              NPCs are covered yet.
            </dd>  
            <dt>Bonus portraits</dt>
            <dd>
              Portraits for several non-joinable NPCs who didn't have portraits
              before but were singled out as part of the 'core' collection, for
              example Gorion.	   
            </dd>
            <dt>Supporting characters</dt>
            <dd>
              Several important secondary characters such as end of chapter 
              bosses or prominent quest givers.
            </dd>
            <dt>Minor characters</dt>
            <dd>
              A larger group of NPCs which generally can be completely ignored
              in the game and offer very limited interaction.	   
            </dd>
          </dl>
          Of the above, only the components for portraits which are actually 
          included in this particular mod version will show. An extra option
          is the manual choice between alternative portraits for NPCs which
          come with more than one: for every such character, you will be
          prompted to pick one - the names showed correspond to subdirectories
          of the portrait directory for the NPC. You may view them manually
          under <tt>npc/&lt;game&gt;</tt> or in included gallery files. 
	  
          <h3>Alternative portraits</h3>
          This is a small configuration component which allows to manually
          select between alternative portrait versions offered by the following
          components. Not installing it will result in the mod picking the
          default option for every NPC. The first option is the same as the
          'select between alternatives' from the first component: a command line
          prompt will display available options and ask for picking one similar
          to how WeiDU components with several alternative subcomponents are
          handled. The second option is the same, but for each NPC it will first
          display a html gallery showing the portraits in the default browser.
          Note that for the purpose of all other components, picking whichever
          of the versions has the side effect of setting it as 'default'.
          In the result, components referring to "alternate versions" will since
          use all <i>not chosen</i> portraits of the given NPC.

          <h3>Portraits of companions</h3>
          This component presents the choice which joinable NPCs should
          receive portraits from this mod and covers both official Bioware and 
          Beamdog NPCs and those from fan-made modifications. The options here 
          are similar to those offered by the first component, but it allows 
          also to decide on the per NPC basis instead of installing the whole 
          groups.

          <h3>Unify all returning companions to use the same portrait files</h3>
          Bioware companions reappearing in BG2 had different portraits than in
          the first game. This component will patch their files, as well as well
          as similar cases of mod NPCs, to refer to the portrait names from 
          the game of their first appearance. It may be useful for EET so that
          now unused files can be overriden with portraits for PC. If no NPC 
          portraits were installed this component will be unavailable.	
  
          <h3>Portraits of Obe's training companions</h3>
          In BG prologue, during the combat tutorial, the player is joined by 
          several ilusory and - very - temporary companions. This component 
          offers to replace them with portraits matching those of of other NPCs.
          From the above - whom most players will not see in repeated plays - 
          Arkanis and Deder are singled out for separate installation as their 
          real counterparts show up in Candlekeep Catacombs and have speaking 
          lines. As for all intents and purposes these are de facto portraits 
          for player charaters, a very similar component is also offered in the 
          in the CHARNAME component group.

          <h3>Portraits of non-joinable NPCs</h3>
          This component offers portraits for non-joinable characters. Several
          installation options are available: you can either manually decide for
          each group of NPCs, or select one of sensible configurations. These
          are similar, but more numerous, to those offered by the first 
          component. If appropriate portraits are available, one additional
          NPC group is listed: the 'extras' who are of no real importance to
          the plot, such as for example tavern keepers or one-line messengers.

          <h3>Replace official companion portraits from other games</h3>
          This component offers to replace standard portraits available in
          the game files - and potentially offered to players - but not used
          in the unmodified game. This in particular includes all BG1 portraits
          in a BG2 installation. It is useful for mods which reintroduce such 
          a companion (as a lot of them use the old portrait files), or for
          consistency's sake: for example, preconfigured characters which come
          with the game will use the new portraits. Available subcomponents 
          distinguish between portraits of characters not present normally 
          in the game (for example, Xan in BG2) and 'old' portraits of present 
          companions.  A closely related component overwriting these portraits 
          with unique and unrelated characters is offered in the CHARNAME 
          component group, so there is no need to install this one solely for 
          the sake of the character generation screen.

          <h3>Portrait change to and from Edwina</h3>
          This is a minor component based on original code by cliffette which
          switches Edwin's portrait for the duration of his accident. As its
          variant is offered by several other mods, it is advisable, although
          not strictly necessary, to install only one of such components. 
          Edwina's files are bundled with bonus NPCs and, provided other 
          mods use the same names of 'EdwinaL' and 'EdwinaM', will overwrite 
          those installed previously without installing this component.
        </div>


        <h2 id="PC">Components with portraits for PC</h2>
        <div class="section">

          <h3>Portraits for player characters</h3>	
          This component offers several recommended installation configurations
          of portraits for player characters, giving you the chance to skip
          manual selection of individual componenets. Not installing it will
          also skip all the following components. You must choose here the
          installation method and whether you want to go manually through all
          the component. The methods are:
          <dl>
            <dt><i>Standard</i></dt>
            <dd>
              This will simply copy the installed portraits to the appropriate
              directory as with manual installation of custom portraits. For
              Enhanced Editions, this is the 'portraits' subdirectory of
              the game's directory in user's 'Documents and folders' 
              (or equivalent). Installed portraits will always appear for
              both genders. Choose this if you encounter conflicts with other
              methods.
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Independent</i></dt>
            <dd>
              This will register installed portraits independently for both
              genders on each game start-up. The new portraits will appear
              after any previously existing on the lists. This method requires
              game patch 2.5, but is guaranteed to work with all future patches
              and is completely isolated from other mods. The only possibility 
              for conflict is with GUI mods which completely bypass standard
              portrait lists used by the game. This is a good choice if you
              plan on using such mods or want to keep your existing portrait	
              collection. This precludes modification of existing portrait	              lists and some components offering this functionality will be 
              skipped even with the option 'decide for each component'.	      
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Direct patching of game files</i></dt>
            <dd>
              This is the most fully-featured method as it allows free 
              modification of existing portrait lists. The code patches
              the portrait lists for both genders in a way which should be
              compatible with any other well-behaved WeiDU mod, but as always,
              there is a risk that future game patches will break it if the
              whole portrait selection were to be reimplemented. You have the
              choice here of either adding new portraits to the existing 
              selection, or replacing it completely. The former will
              <i>merge</i> the lists, so all portraits will appear 
              alphabetically sorted. The latter will remove all standard 
              portraits and portraits installed by other mods in the same way.
              Note that portraits installed using one of the former methods
              are exempt from modification: this mod won't delete your existing
              files and can't bypass hard-coded search of the 'portraits'
              directory and portraits added by mods during application start-up     	    </dd>
          </dl>
          All of these methods can be used either as 'one-click' installations,
          which include default selections of portraits unique to player
          characters, or in the 'decide for each component' variant, which 
          offers a fine-grained control over what is installed, an option to
          use NPC portraits or modify the existing ones. Additionally, it is
          also possible here to choose to overwrite the default portraits 
          (this includes Obe's companions, but not 'real' NPCs).

          <h3>Remove portraits from the character generation selection</h3>
          This component offers to either clear all NPC and PC portraits 
          currently on the portrait lists in the game files, or pick 
          individually types of portraits to remove in the following components.
          All following components from the 'remove portraits' category will
          be offered only if the latter is chosen. This component 
          (nor any from this category) will not be offered unless 'direct 
          game patching' is chosen as the installation method.

          <h3>Remove portraits of official companions from the selection</h3>
          This will make unavailable to players the portraits of NPCs.
          The choice is between removing all NPC portraits, those actually
          used in the game, or all portraits of present companions (so, for
          example, both BG1 and BG2 portrait of Minsc).

          <h3>Remove portraits of Obe's companions from the selection</h3>
          This can make unavailable to players either all portraits of
          the illusory companions from the combat training in the BG1 prologue
          (essentially, most of 'classic' PC portraits), or only those of
          Arkanis and Deder (who show up as real characters later in BG1).	  
          <h3>Replace default CHARNAME portraits</h3>
    	  This offers to override standard non-companion portraits with new
          included images. There is choice to limit this to only portraits
          not used in the game (PC-only), or to include Obe's companions
          (with or without Deder). Additionally, you may choose between
          either using <i>copies</i> of included portraits or <i>unique</i>
          portraits. The difference is that the latter precludes those
          portraits from being installed by later components, the former does
          not. The logical decision is to use copies if you chose to remove
          those portraits from the selection screen (which will limit the effect
          to the standard pregenerated characters or, at worst, risk you 
          meeting a doppelganger early on in Obe's basement) and to use unique
          files if the overriden portraits where left in the existing lists.
          The opposite choice will, respectively, make some unique portraits
          completely unavailable to you, or result in duplicates during
          character generation.

          <h3>Replace unused portraits of NPCs</h3>
          This component offers to override the portraits of NPCs which are
          unused by the game with unique and <i>unrelated</i> portraits for
          player characters. The choice is between unused ('old') portraits
          of companions from the given game, portraits of companions
          - normally - absent in the game, or both. This will <i>not</i>
          overwrite any portraits already overwritten by the similar component
          in the NPC group and the subcomponent	corresponding to the choice
          made there will not be offered. This option is only really useful
          if the overwritten portraits remain on the selection lists and may
          not show at all based on previous choices. Similarly, it will not
          show for games which don't have unused portraits.

          <h3>Give PC the portraits of Obe's companions</h3>
          This component will show up only if the direct installation method
          was chosen and the corresponding portraits where removed from the 
          portrait list in the first place or were not overriden. You will
          have the option of adding portraits of all Obe's companions to the 
          players' list or to exclude Arkanis and Deder. It has 
          an unobvious use - why give something you have just taken away 
          or is already there? First, all components in this category do not 
          actually add the original files - overriden or not - but copies
          of included dedicated override files which are differently named.
          This is done so that all installed portraits follow a logical order
          after sorting (which would be broken by the standard portrait names).
          If you choose to install this component without removing the 
          portraits of the corresponding characters, you will end up with both
          the old and replacement versions. Removing those characters previously
          will be equivalent to simply overriding the old files, but with a	          portraits in a better order.
         
          <h3>Give PC portraits of official companions</h3>
          This will install for the player included replacements for standard
          NPCs. The choice is between various combinations of which companions'
          portraits you want to install (all or absent) and if you want
          their default, non-default or all portraits. This will never result
          two identical images on the list, regardless of what previous
          installation options you have chosen for NPCs and PC.	  

          <h3>Give PC portraits of companions from mods for this game</h3>
          This will install for the player included replacements for NPCs
          introduced by certain mods. The choice is again between default
          vs. alternative portraits and installed vs. absent vs. all known
          mod companions.
	  
          <h3>Give PC portraits of companions from mods for other games</h3>
          This will install for the player included replacements for NPCs
          introduced by some mods for other games. If an NPC has a mod for
          both the current game and others, they will not be included here.	
          The choice is simple between all and non-default portraits for
          an NPC.

          <h3>Give CHARNAME unique portraits</h3>
          This is the main component granting the properly unique portraits
          to player characters. You can choose to install the default set,
          all portraits, or to decide individually for each included portrait
          bundle, optionally after being shown an html preview gallery.
          Additionally, if you can specify you whish to exclude certain types
          of portraits (currently grouped as characters older than the 
          protagonist's backstory suggests, non-playable (without proxing) 
          races and cameos - portraits of characters from other media.
          This will proceed to offer you components where individual
          decisions can be made. In all other cases this component will
          round up the installation. If you opt to see preview galleries,
          they will include only portraits actually to be installed, excluding
          any character groups you opt out of using the following components. 

          <h3>Exclude female portraits</h3>
          This component will be available only if you decide earlier to 
          exclude certain portrait types and if you are following the
          'standard' installation method which results in a joint pool
          of portraits for both genders. Installing it will prevent
          all female portraits from being installed in the result.

          <h3>Exclude male portraits</h3>
          This component will be available only if you decide earlier to
          exclude certain portrait types and if you are following the
          'standard' installation method - and if you do not exclude all
          female portraits. Installing it will prevent all male portraits
          from being installed.

          <h3>Exclude older characters</h3>
          This will prevent from installing portraits of characters much older
	  than the 20 years old the protagonist is supposed to be.

          <h3>Exclude non-playable races</h3>
          This will prevent from installing certain races such as Drow and 
          Tieflings.

          <h3>Exclude recognisable cameos</h3>
          This will prevent from installing fanart of characters from other
          games, films etc.

          <ul>
            <li>
              This mod can't - and probably shouldn't - remove custom PC
              portraits added manually or by other mods unless they also patched
              the BGEE.lua file.	      
            </li>
            <li>
              Picking a non-default portrait for a NPC makes it the new 
              default (by design). If you choose to give PC access to their
              alternative portraits you may receive two images with very minor
              differences you would not if you chose the default. This will
              happen if the default portrait has a very close alternative (as	              they often do) but is much too complex to prevent due to 
              component interactions. This is not considered a bug.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choices of alternative companion portraits don't transfer between
              the games outside of EET. If you choose a non-default replacement
              for Khalid in BG1 and install the component granting PC 
              alternative portraits of absent companions in BG2, you will get
              the same portrait he used in BG1. It is unclear what the fix 
              should be (and if it is needed).
            </li>
	    <li>
              The great mod <i>PortraitPicker</i> which adds search and 
              filter functions to the portrait list on the character generation
              screen maintains its own portrait lists and ignores those in the
              game files - it will ignore all portraits	added using any other
              method than 'standard'. This mod generates/updates a list in	              PortraitPicker's format during installation, but must be installed
              after it, otherwise the later will clear that list. This is 
              inherent to its implementation and until cross-mod decision is 
              taken you must install it before this mod.

              Not tested EET support.
