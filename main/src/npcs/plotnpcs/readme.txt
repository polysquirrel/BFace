Groups non-joinable game characters, important to the plot and, 
in general, with already existing portraits which should not be 
made available to player characters.

All portrait files should be placed in directories at 4th level,
with default naming convention following:

./<game>/<gender>/<npc>/<portraitfile>

One exception is possiblity of existance of 'alternative' folder
placed on the deepest level, next to the portrait files for an npc,
and containing a group of folders with alternative portraits. 
Each of these folders should contain a set of files with exactly 
the same names as the portrait files present next to the 'alternative'
directory.
