Groups joinable, official Bioware/Beamdog NPCs.

All portrait files should be placed in directories at 4th level,
with default naming convention following:

./<game>/<gender>/<npc>/<portraitfile>

One exception is possiblity of existance of 'alternatives' folder
placed on the deepest level, next to the portrait files for an npc,
and containing a group of folders with alternative portraits. 
Each of these folders should contain a set of files with exactly 
the same names as the portrait files present next to the 'alternative'
directory.
