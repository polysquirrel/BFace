Groups portraits dedicated to player characters. While, for interoperabilitly,
this directory tree shares structure and depth with the npc potrait directories,
it is much more lax with the purpose of individual directories. In particular
the bottom 'npc' level is completely arbitrary and used simply for organization
of possibly large number of files (by default by race). Similarly, this level
does not group portraits by game but their existance and current function in the game.

All portrait files should be placed in directories at 4th level,
with default naming convention following:

./<game>/<gender>/<npc|race>/<portraitfile>
